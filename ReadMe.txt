In order to compile:	$make P0
In order to run: 	$./P0 [fileName]	//where fileName is name of custom output file
In order to clean:	$make clean

I foresee no issues with running this.

I did have a problem where, I think, I'm making an extra node somewhere and it's making the file output have a weird character, but other than that it works as far as I can tell
